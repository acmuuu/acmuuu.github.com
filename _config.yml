# The production_url is only used when full-domain names are needed
# such as sitemap.txt 
# Most places will/should use BASE_PATH to make the urls
#
# If you have set a CNAME (pages.github.com) set your custom domain here.
# Else if you are pushing to username.github.io, replace with your username.
# Finally if you are pushing to a GitHub project page, include the project name at the end.

# All Jekyll-Bootstrap specific configurations are namespaced into this hash
#
JB :
version : 0.3.0

# All links will be namespaced by BASE_PATH if defined.
# Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{BASE_PATH}}
# however this value will be dynamically changed depending on your deployment situation.
#
# CNAME (http://yourcustomdomain.com)
#   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH 
#   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
#
# GitHub Pages (http://username.github.io)
#   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH 
#   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
#
# GitHub Project Pages (http://username.github.io/project-name)
#
#   A GitHub Project site exists in the `gh-pages` branch of one of your repositories.
#  REQUIRED! Set BASE_PATH to: http://username.github.io/project-name
#
# CAUTION:
#   - When in Localhost, your site will run from root "/" regardless of BASE_PATH
#   - Only the following values are falsy: ["", null, false]
#   - When setting BASE_PATH it must be a valid url.
#     This means always setting the protocol (http|https) or prefixing with "/"
BASE_PATH : false

# By default, the asset_path is automatically defined relative to BASE_PATH plus the enabled theme.
# ex: [BASE_PATH]/assets/themes/[THEME-NAME]
#
# Override this by defining an absolute path to assets here.
# ex: 
#   http://s3.amazonaws.com/yoursite/themes/watermelon
#   /assets
#

# These paths are to the main pages Jekyll-Bootstrap ships with.
# Some JB helpers refer to these paths; change them here if needed.

# Settings for all other include helpers can be defined by creating

#
#   pages_list :

#
# Setting any helper's provider to 'custom' will bypass the helper code
# and include your custom code. Your custom file must be defined at:
#   ./_includes/custom/[HELPER]
# where [HELPER] is the name of the helper you are overriding.
